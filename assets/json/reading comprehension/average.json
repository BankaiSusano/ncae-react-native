    	"In 1841 a young man addressed an anti-slavery meeting in Massachusetts. He talked about what it was like to be separated from one's family as a child. He talked about being beaten and overworked. He talked about learning how to read and write in secret. He talked about what it was like to be a slave. Perhaps one of the reasons the listeners were so impressed with the speaker was because he had been a slave himself.",
		"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in 1818 in Maryland. His last name was Bailey, the name of his mother. First he was separated from his mother, then his grandmother. He eventually was sent to work for a family named Auld. Sophia Auld taught Frederick how to read and write. By the time her husband stopped her, Frederick had learned enough to progress on his own. Later, Frederick worked for a man named Covey, who often beat him. One night Frederick resisted the beating and the two men fought for two hours. This was a dangerous thing for a slave to do, but Covey finally gave up. Frederick was never beaten again.",
		"In 1836, Frederick and other slaves tried to escape. Someone betrayed them and the attempt failed. Shortly after that, Frederick met Anna Murray, a free black woman, and the two fell in love. In 1838, Frederick planned another escape, and this time he successfully reached New York City. He and Anna were married shortly thereafter. Frederick decided to change his last name to symbolize his new freedom. He took the name Douglass from a character in a book a friend of his was reading at the time.",
		"Frederick Douglass's presence was a tremendous boost to the anti-slavery movement. Anyone who had doubts about the morality or violence of slavery had only to listen to the articulate former slave describe his former life. After President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Douglass helped recruit black soldiers to fight for the Union in the Civil War. He died in 1895 after a long, full life.",

    	"First, be sure to keep the broken ends quiet. Keep the adjacent joints still. Should these joints bend, the muscles will act against the fractured bone and cause motion. Give the victim first aid for shock. Apply a sterile dressing to the fracture if it is compound. Do not try to push back a protruding bone. When you are splinting the fractured area, the end will slip back when the limb is straightened. An ice bag should be used with all fractures, sprains, and dislocations. A simple method of preventing motion of the fragments is to place the limb on pillows. Splints may also be used to keep the limb from moving. Breaks of the ribs or skull bone need no splints as they are held fast by other bones and tissue",

In her arms Wendy held the gifts she had brought them-twin infant girls from Vietnam, the newest members of the Grant family. The Grants' six adopted Vietnamese children, and over 1,600 others like them, may well owe their lives to the determination of Wendy, her husband Duane, and a handful of other dedicated women and men.",
		"Like all wars, the war in Vietnam left thousands of children homeless. Their villages had been burned or blown to rubble. Their parents had been killed or lost amid the swarm of refugees clogging the dusty roads. The lucky children were taken in by orphanages. The rest were left to roam rural paths or city streets by themselves. They avoided starvation only by begging, stealing, or rummaging in garbage piles; they slept in gutters. Many were scarred or crippled by land mines, disease, or malnutrition.",
		"It was in 1964 that the Grants, who had already adopted three American children, first heard of the plight of the Vietnamese orphans. Immediately they began the complicated task of adopting one-a girl, whom they named Diahan.",
		"But soon Wendy realized that more must be done. Together with Duane and several other Americans, she founded an organization called Friends for All Children. The group located American homes for the war orphans and helped bring them to the United States. With the money they raised, they set up four orphanages in Vietnam.",
		"Twice Wendy went to Vietnam herself, despite the constant danger of enemy attack. Once she adopted and brought home a girl, Tia, so crippled by polio that she could not even stand. Today, thanks to American doctors, Tia walks unaided. On Wendy's final trip, with the enemy closing in on the capital city of Saigon, she remained until the last minute, arranging for orphans to be flown to the United States, Canada, and Australia. She narrowly missed a fatal plane crash.",

    	"The story of how the girl Pocahontas saved John Smith's life is well known to most grade-school children. Pocahontas did even more to establish peaceful relations between New World and Old World people. However, Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan, chief of a powerful league of over 30 tribes of Algonquian-speaking Indians (Native Americans) in the area around Jamestown, Virginia, in the early 1600s. The young girl's given name was Matoaka, but she was called Pocahontas, meaning "the playful one." In 1607, Pocahontas' life became even more interesting. At that time, a group of English colonists arrived on her people's land and settled very close to her village. Her father, Powhatan, made no aggressive moves against the settlers at first, but he did feel that they represented a threat to the Indian nation.",
		"By 1608, it began to appear that the English settlers were not going to leave on their own as others before them had. It was at that time that one settler was captured while hunting. The prisoner, John Smith, was brought to Powhatan. According to one source, Smith's future was about to be decided when Pocahontas cried out for him to be saved. In the Algonquian culture, that kind of request could save a prisoner's life, so Smith was spared. Smith stayed in the village for several weeks after that and became good friends with many of the Algonquians.",
		"Several braves then returned John Smith to Jamestown and on their return to Powhatan told the chief that the settlers were very ill and starving. Pocahontas overheard this. She did not want these people to die, so she brought food to the settlement on a regular basis during that time. Many said that it was Pocahontas who kept the colony alive.",
		"Over time, however, tension mounted between the Jamestown settlers and the Algonquians, and eventually Pocahontas was forbidden by Powhatan to visit the English settlement. Around that time, the new governor of Jamestown, Samuel Argall, had Chief Powhatan's daughter taken as a hostage to be traded for English prisoners and some rifles that the Algonquians had taken. Powhatan's reply to the capture was that he would return the prisoners but not the guns. In fact, Powhatan was quite certain that the settlers would never harm Pocahontas.",
		"Meanwhile, in the Jamestown settlement, Pocahontas was treated very well. She had many friends there already and was allowed to visit from house to house. During her long stay, she took on the religion of the settlers, and she also took the English name Rebecca. It was during this time that she met John Rolfe, a settler who had introduced tobacco growing to the Virginia colony. Rolfe asked permission to marry Rebecca. Permission was granted by the governor of the colony and, 10 days later, by Powhatan. Every Jamestown settler, two of Rebecca's uncles, and two of her brothers attended the wedding. This union was followed by eight years of peace between the Indians and the English and was often referred to as the "Peace of Pocahontas."",
		"The Rolfes had one son, Thomas. After Rebecca Rolfe's untimely death in her early 20s, John and Thomas Rolfe continued to live and work in Jamestown.",

As the dial turns clockwise, always record the figure the pointer has just passed. Read the next dial to the left and record the figure it has just passed.

It is located on the island of Heimaey, just off the mainland. One January night in 1973, however, householders were shocked from their sleep. In some backyards, red-hot liquid was spurting from the ground. Flaming "skyrockets" shot up and over the houses. The island's volcano, Helgafell, silent for 7,000 years, was violently erupting!",
		"Luckily, the island's fishing fleet was in port, and within 24 hours almost everyone was ferried to the mainland. But then the agony of the island began in earnest. As in a nightmare, fountains of burning lava spurted 300 feet high. Black, baseball-size cinders rained down. An evil-smelling, eye-burning, throat-searing cloud of smoke and gas erupted into the air, and a river of lava flowed down the mountain. The constant shriek of escaping steam was punctuated by ear-splitting explosions.",
		"As time went on, the once pleasant village of Vestmannaeyjar took on a weird aspect. Its street lamps still burning against the long Arctic night, the town lay under a thick blanket of cinders. All that could be seen above the 10-foot black drifts were the tips of street signs. Some houses had collapsed under the weight of cinders, while others had burst into flames as the heat ignited their oil storage tanks. Lighting the whole lurid scene, fire continued to shoot from the mouth of the looming volcano.",
		"The eruption continued for six months. Scientists and reporters arrived from around the world to observe the awesome natural event. But the town did not die that easily. In July, when the eruption ceased, the people of Heimaey Island returned to assess the chances of rebuilding their homes and lives. They found tons of ash covering the ground. The Icelanders are a tough people, however, accustomed to the strange and violent nature of their Arctic land. They dug out their homes. They even used the cinders to build new roads and airport runways. Now the new homes of Heimaey are warmed from water pipes heated by molten lava.",
